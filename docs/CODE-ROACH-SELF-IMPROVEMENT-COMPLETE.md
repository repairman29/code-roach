## 🚀 What Code Roach Can Do

### Self-Improvement Capabilities

1. **Self-Scan** ✅
   - Scans all 13+ Code Roach service files
   - Finds issues automatically
   - Categorizes by severity (critical, high, medium, low)

2. **Self-Fix** ✅
   - Fixes bugs in its own code automatically
   - Uses all fix generators (pattern, codebase-aware, context-aware, LLM)
   - Validates fixes before applying
   - Uses continuous learning cycles

3. **Self-Optimize** ✅
   - Profiles its own performance
   - Identifies bottlenecks
   - Suggests optimizations
   - Tracks performance improvements

4. **Self-Refactor** ✅
   - Finds code duplication
   - Detects complexity issues
   - Suggests refactoring opportunities
   - **Already refactored itself: 64% nesting reduction!**

5. **Self-Test** ✅
   - Generates tests for itself
   - Improves test coverage
   - Creates unit and integration tests
